## Writing Style

We want a simple conversational style. We want to write with one voice. We don't want to create a style guide. Therefore, we define our style by reference and exception.

Use the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/). We like this guide because it is freely available online, has a [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), and it leverages [other good style resources](https://developers.google.com/style/resources).
