## Journey of your Career

### Your Great!

You are pretty sure you are good at what you do, some day's you might even say you are amazing at your job! How do you make sure others know how good you are - I don't mean in the periphery of their mind "they do good work" sort of way, but have your name at the tip of their tongue when new opportunities come up? Is not easy, especially when you are surrounded by others doing great work at the same time; here are some ideas to help you out.

I like lists of three's, short enough to remember and long enough to get some good direction.

#### Short Version

1. Define yourself
2. Pick an audience
3. Communicate regularly

#### Define Yourself

This is probably the hardest step, for a simple reason, everyone hates tradeoffs. Very important point, all strategy requires explicit (very clear, no ambiguity) or implicit (not defined, but understood by all) tradeoffs. If there are no tradeoffs, there is a very high likelihood of failing at everything. No one can be good at, or do, everything!

Example: "I work in the public cloud." VS "I am a Google Cloud Platform expert, specializing in high level project architecture and staying informed of the ever changing offerings Google creates, discards, or re-brands."

Try creating a few of these statements, feel them out, see how they fit you.

Some things to consider when making these:

* Ensure you enjoy working in your target area, you may be spending a lot of time there
* Check to see if there is work where you are aiming!
    * Wanting to be the best ALGOL developer may not make sense
* Make sure it aligns with your career ladder somehow
* Your organization Leveling Guide
* Look at the market, know what it values in your space and keep it in mind
    * Expertise in Excel may be good, but expertise in VBLite for Excel may be better
* After deciding your brand, and who you are, look for proof. If you are claiming something, how can you prove it? Consider something like a Brag Doc, items from your quarterly reviews, things you have received Props Points for, actions people gave you kudos for, etc.

Now you should have a good idea of who you are and what you want to share. This takes time and energy! Don't worry too much about getting it exact, everyone re-brands all of the time. If you turn out not like it or it does not work out, try again with something else!

#### Pick an Audience

With a strategy and evidence, you are ready to share! How do you get traction and figure out who to share what with?

Start with your Pod Lead or Direct Manager, they have the largest ability to affect your work and the most interest in ensuring everyone knows how good you are. They can be your partner is refining your brand and getting the word out. Hint, this is all great content for your 1on1's!

Engage and communicate with the Tech Lead on your project. They should know and be aware of the great things you are doing! They may or may not be in your organization or leadership, but it is still important they know you! Make sure they understand where you are knowledgeable.

The Client Engagement person on your project should know you are someone they can call on for help and to answer questions in the area you are an expert in.

Create influence everywhere you can!

Here are some examples if your audience is Technical Leadership:

* Start writing about your expertise here in the Technology Blog
* Answer questions in Teams, Slack, Discord (No Stupid Questions Club, Technology General, etc.)
* Spin up small group meetings showing others what you know
* Get involved in the community surrounding the space you are going after
* Check out some open source: https://github.com/explore
* Join Stack Overflow Collectives: https://stackoverflow.com/collectives
* Find CoE's and groups to join in your organization
* If there is no Meetup, make one! https://www.meetup.com/start/organizing
* Volunteer to help in anything related to your area

The goal is to attach your name to as many instances of answers around your selected area of expertise as possible. When people search or think of the technology, process, or space, they should find you!

#### Communicate Regularly

With your brand and the where to communicate, start pushing content regularly. Blog posts every month or two, questions in meetings whenever they come up, how-to's with fellow team members every quarter, etc. This part takes discipline and requires commitment, which is why it is essential what you picked is something you enjoy doing! As time goes on you will be able to look back and see a pile of content and connections across the organization and industry.

But wait! Now you are typecast for a specific thing, what about other work you may want to do? This is a great point, luckily humans easily fall prey to the halo effect, essentially, if you are seen as good at something - people assume you are good at other things related to it. This means you can build on this effect, adjust your brand and pick the next thing you want to be known for!

There is a lot here and it ended up being longer than I expected, but the topic is far from completely explored!
