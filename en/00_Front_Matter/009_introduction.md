# Introduction

Journey Driven Development (JDD) is our attempt to codify how we create software for clients at VMLY&R. The phrase, 'for clients,' is important to us as it reminds us that our clients judge our work not only by how it runs but also by examining its source code critically as it was developed for hire.

We wrote JDD for ourselves, the developers, analysts, testers, architects, and operators of the software we create for our clients. We share it as we believe the lessons learned will be useful to software teams generally. You don't have to code to benefit from JDD but it helps to have worked on a software team.

We work at an agency, VMLY&R. Sometimes we say advertising agency and sometimes we say marketing agency. We think of ourselves as agents of change or transformation.

Our software is delivered quickly. Our clients are demanding. We often shepard the software through the initial launch and sometimes through years of updates, but our clients own the software we create and operate it long-term.

Goals:

1. Make higher quality software faster.
2. Make it easier for people to learn our process.
3. Make it easier for people to create their own process by forking this.
