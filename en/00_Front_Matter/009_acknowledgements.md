# Acknowledgements

<!--Another part of front matter is an acknowledgement, which is written by the author and acknowledges those who have helped him/her in the writing of the publication.-->

The [Pro Git book](https://github.com/progit/progit2) inspired us to use Pandoc for this.

Discovered after we started that [Daniele Dellafiore](https://medium.com/@ildella) wrote  about something similar she called User-Journey Driven Development](https://medium.com/@ildella/i-am-about-to-start-a-new-one-day-project-and-i-am-going-to-test-a-new-process-888e3e29a76f) in August of 2015.

Thanks to [Billie Thompson (a.k.a., PurpleBooth)](https://github.com/PurpleBooth) for providing the starter contributing.md template, which we took from [Good-CONTRIBUTING.md-template.md](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426)
