### API Forward and Microservices

Microservices.io provides a good baseline for understanding what we mean by a microservice:

1. Highly maintainable and testable
2. Loosely coupled
3. Independently deployable
4. Organized around business capabilities
5. Owned by a small team

Most modern discussions of microservices include a few more expectations, such as:

1. Microservices execute and participate in a service mesh
2. There is a consistent and predictable contract across services, at a macro-level
3. Are easily composable with other services
4. Fine grained, distributed traceability
5. Graceful fault tolerance and resiliency

Unpacking the service mesh a bit more, we find these additional expectations:

1. Dynamic registration/discovery
2. Independent and precise auto-scaling
3. Health check telemetry
4. Polyglot support
