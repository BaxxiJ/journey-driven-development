## DevOps

DevOps is a set of technical, architectural, and cultural practices for teams developing and operating the software that enables customer journeys and delivers value.
DevOps applies principles from improvement of physical manufacturing to the IT value stream.
The technical practices include techniques for automation of application delivery and deployment, infrastructure as code, and automated testing.
Architecturally, DevOps includes decisions to organize infrastructure and applications for agility and resiliency.
Finally, DevOps depends on a culture that breaks down silos between the work of development, operations, quality and security.

### Manufacturing and IT Value Stream

Physical manufacturing turns raw materials into finished goods for sale.
The raw materials for software are business hypothesis resulting from insights into customer journeys.
The IT value stream describes the process to convert business hypotheses into working software.
DevOps uses techniques from the Lean and Toyota Kata movements to optimize the IT value stream the way those techniques optimized physical manufacturing.
Gene Kim, author of *The Pheonix Project* describes the "three ways" essential for all DevOps practices.

The Three Ways:

* First Way: Flow
* Second Way: Feedback
* Third Way: Continual Learning and Experimentation

DevOps optimizes flow in the IT value stream to minimize lead time.
Lead time is the amount of time it takes for a feature to move from being an idea to being available to a customer.
Optimizing flow depends on reducing the size of work moving through the value stream (i.e. reducing batch size) and building quality into the process.

Feedback loops are essential to improving flow. 
Feeback loops allow teams to prevent problems from recurring or detect problems more quickly to enable recovery.
Without Feedback teams cannot learn or improve.

Building off of Flow and Feedback loops, teams experiment with improving flow and use feedback loops to learn if an experiment is successful or not.
As these experiments yield success and failures, the team learns how to optimize or change processes to increase speed and safety.
Running many smaller experiments helps teams manage risk and build resiliency into systems.
