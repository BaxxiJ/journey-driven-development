# Process

On some level, this whole book is about process. We added a specific section on process because we believe that methodology concerns itself first with people, process, and tools. Through revisions, we extracted architecture from the tools list and techniques as a sort of smaller scale process. I'm struggling here to to avoid calling a technique a micro-process, but it seems clear to us that what remains here after removing techniques is a sort of macro-process, or process in the large.
