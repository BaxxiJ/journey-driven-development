## Agile at VMLY&R

First... what is agile? Or is it Agile? Either way, in it's basic form Agile is a principled approach to rapidly generating feedback for an iterative approach. If it was a process, you might see only 4 steps:

1. Pick a direction to go
2. Take a step in that direction
3. Evaluate progress and impact
4. Repeat

Yep. That's it. Nothing special.

At VMLY&R we believe that Agile is more of a mindset rather than a methodology or a process. It's a set of principles that helps guide the way we work so that we are always gathering feedback and applying that feedback to our ever evolving direction. Over time we expect our direction to narrow in on providing the most value to the end user. When we find ourselves drifting from that path we proactively take steps to pivot.
